Esteemed editor and reviewers,

I have submitted the codes utilized for the reverse prediction of lens parameters, along with six datasets of lenses V and H, as well as the MSE and MMD losses of INNs for these six datasets of lenses V and H. 
Please feel free to examine them as required. I am grateful for your valuable review.
